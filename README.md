**[Listen now](https://tyler-james-bridges.github.io/pulse/)**

## The Algorithm Sound

A series exploring the music of social media. Each pattern translates a digital experience into sound.

- **The Doomscroll** - An endless loop that never resolves. Suspended chords that won't come home. The sound of just one more scroll.

## Covers & Originals

- **Blue Monday** - New Order's synth-pop classic
- **Stranger Things** - The haunting synth theme
- **I'm Summer** - Original bright composition
